I went to the [Polynesian Cultural Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_Cultural_Center) and visited the [Laie temple](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/laie-hawaii-temple/) in November 2024.

This is the only LDS temple on a pressed penny that I am aware of. If there are more, I'd love to hear about it.
