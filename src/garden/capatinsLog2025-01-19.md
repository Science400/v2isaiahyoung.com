The other day I thought about Bungalo Boys and the Big Fish Wish and searched it in DuckDuckGo. I was surprised when a copy of the disk showed up on Archive.org. It was posted in 2022, so 2 years after I wrote Frank Edwards.

I spent yesterday trying to get 86box running to play the game. I got it running, but it stuttered too much to even make it through the intro scene. I'll have to tweak the setup so it runs better on my laptop.

We went on a walk today and I took a bunch of notes for my new nature journal. It was fun to observe nature.
