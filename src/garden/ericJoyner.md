I recently discovered the artist [Eric Joyner](https://ericjoyner.com/). He paints a lot of pieces featuring atomic era robots and donuts. It's quite the world he's created. 

My current favorites are [New Frontier (2024)](https://ericjoyner.com/product/new-frontier/) and [Mom (2024)](https://ericjoyner.com/product/mom/).

Many different ships of various vintages are blasting around. There are also several atomic era robots and a handful of donuts.'](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/robotsanddonuts/wp-media-folder-eric-joyner/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-Frontier.jpg 'New Frontier (2024) by Eric Joyner')

Most of the donuts are colorfully frosted.'](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/robotsanddonuts/wp-media-folder-eric-joyner/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mom.jpg 'Mom (2024) by Eric Joyner')

I'm currently saving up some money so I can by some of his art.
