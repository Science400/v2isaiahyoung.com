My town of Springville called for flag redesign submissions. My wife and I submitted the following designs with the help of my brother that drew them in Illustrator

For this design we chose to stick with the current colors of the Springville logo. But the color palette is still reminiscent of the new Utah flag. The S curve is for Springville, but it can also represent Hobble Creek winding through the middle of town.

For this design we still stuck with the current colors of the Springville logo. The red section represents the mountains towering over Springville. Standing at the town center you can see the mountain sloping off toward Hobble Creek canyon similar to the red in the flag. The red also symbolizes the firm foundation we come from. The blue section represents Hobble Creek flowing through town. Like water gathers as it flows, we also gather in community as we move forward. The yellow represents the sunrise in the east. This symbolizes our bright future.

About a week after the submissions closed I got the email saying out of the 250 entries, at least one of ours made it past the first round of the top 70, but didn't make it past the second round of the top 15. It was fun working on this project and I'm excited to see what the winner ends up being.
