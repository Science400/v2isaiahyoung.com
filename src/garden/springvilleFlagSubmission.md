My town of Springville called for flag redesign submissions. My wife and I submitted the following designs with the help of my brother that drew them in Illustrator

{# {% image "./src/assets/images/museum/SpringvilleCityFlagDesignContest-03.jpg", "A flag with a yellow S curving through the center with the area above in light blue and the area below in red.", "For this design we chose to stick with the current colors of the Springville logo. But the color palette is still reminiscent of the new Utah flag" %}

{% image "./src/assets/images/museum/SpringvilleCityFlagDesignContest-05.jpg", "A flag with the area divided in half from the upper left to the lower right. The area below is red. The area above is divided in half again from the upper left to the center right with yellow on top of blue. There are fine white lines dividing all of the colors.", "For this design we chose to stick with the current colors of the Springville logo. But the color palette is reminiscent of the new Utah flag. The red section represents the mountains towering over Springville. Standing at the town center you can see the mountain sloping off toward Hobble Creek canyon similar to the red in the flag. The red also symbolizes the firm foundation we come from. The blue section represents Hobble Creek flowing through town. Like water gathers as it flows, so do we gather in community as we move forward. The yellow represents the sunrise in the east. This symbolizes our bright future." %} #}

For this design we chose to stick with the current colors of the Springville logo. But the color palette is still reminiscent of the new Utah flag. The S curve is for Springville, but it can also represent Hobble Creek winding through the middle of town.
