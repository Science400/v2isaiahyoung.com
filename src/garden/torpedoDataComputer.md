I think WWII submarines are pretty neat. I read [*Thunder Below!*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4123224W/Thunder_Below%21) by [Admiral Gene Flucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_B._Fluckey) and [*Run Silent, Run Deep*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL250330W/Run_silent_run_deep) by [Captain Edward Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Beach_Jr.). I even went and visited the [USS Bowfin](https://www.bowfin.org/). I love how analog and human they are. I'm sure there is a better way to describe it.

I'm particularly interested in the Torpedo Data Computer, or TDC. It was a fully mechanical computer that can take continuous inputs from the submarine, calculate a firing solution, and program the torpedos until a second before firing. 

It's even more complex than a slide rule which is the same kind of analog I like. It can even do calculus.

I have an idea kicking around in my head for a pocket TDC using analog electronics, no microcontroller in sight. I still don't know how that's supposed to work, so I'm working on just figuring out the equations involved inside the TDC. It's really simple right now, but it's [here](/tdc/index.html).
