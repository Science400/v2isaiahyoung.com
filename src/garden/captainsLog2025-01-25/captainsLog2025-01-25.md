I went to [Dino Fest 2025] at the [Utah Natural History Museum] today. And it was a lot of fun and we'll probably end up going every year.

I listened to several lectures.

I then saw the holotype skull of [diabloceratops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabloceratops), my favorite ceratopsian.

The skull has two horns above the eye holes. It also has a large hollow frill with a long curved horn on top.", "Me and the diabloceratops holotype skull." %}

Later, I met [Jim Kirkland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I._Kirkland), one of the guys that named and described it.
